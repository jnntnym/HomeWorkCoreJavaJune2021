[for example -- "battery is a ...... method from Java ....."]. When you get a chance to implement interfaceInfo, print out answers for the following questions: [What are the features of Interface you know? Can we create a constructor inside an interface? Can we write variables inside Interface? Don't copy-paste, write how much you can remember, use newline (\n), tab(\t)], for other abstract methods which will be implemented, also print whatever you like. Do you think we can extends or implements Interface? Single or multiple? Create two interface Pager and Wakitaki (Phone interface inherit them) and One regular class name LandPhone and one abstract class SatelitePhone. make a relation of this 4, with Phone if possible.
